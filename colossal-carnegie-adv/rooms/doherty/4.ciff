chem_e Doherty Hall
You're in Doherty Hall. You're in a Chemical Engineering area with a stairwell to your west and a hallway to the south. There is an elevator here. Light streams in through large windows to your east, through which you can see Doherty's roof and a precipitous drop down many stories. There is some comfortable seating here.
